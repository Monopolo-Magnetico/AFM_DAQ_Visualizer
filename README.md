This is the GitHub repository for AFMDAQ Visualizer, a project with the objective of acquiring and processing raw AFM data to plot variables of interest related to the type of microscopy.
This project is currently in a Beta stage. So far, this program is able to plot CSV files from the following microscopies: Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), Force-Time Curves from the Force-Volume Mode, and Topography.
Although rudimentary, a first version of the GUI is available and functional.
